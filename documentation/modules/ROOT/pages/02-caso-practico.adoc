= Creating a Virtual Machine with Bootc Containers
include::_attributes.adoc[]

[#descripcion]
== Description

In this practical case, we will create a virtual machine (VM) from a container image.

We will see how bootc leverages existing container technology to:

* Create the application in terms of its container at creation time—the system is not changed once deployed.
* Automatically access the registry of the deployed container image to automatically update the system.
* Revert the last change.

The infrastructure you will use for this lab is as follows:

image::diagram.png[]

* A laptop with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 as the workstation.
* A virtual machine 

[IMPORTANT]
====
For the lab, use the user **student** and password **redhat** to access the **imagemode** machine using ssh from the laptop.

To access the **image-mode-test** machine once it has been created, you can connect to it via ssh with the **root** user from the **imagemode** machine, using the **demouser** username and password **redhat**.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Once you finish the lab, it is VERY important to log out so that the environment resets and the next user can use it.

Thank you very much!!!

== Creating the First Image

The definition of a container is almost the same as a traditional container, with the only difference being the `+FROM+` clause.

=====

In the case of bootable containers, we are not going to run these images on existing systems but rather create systems with these containers already installed.

We can create systems in several ways:

1. With images for virtual machines.
2. By creating DVDs (ISO) that we can use to automatically install a bare-metal server with [kickstart](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/automatically_installing_rhel/automated-installation-workflow_rhel-installer#automated-installation-workflow_rhel-installer).

In this lab, we will focus on point 1. We will use [bootc-image-builder](https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder) to create a KVM-type VM to run on Linux using [libvirt](https://libvirt.org).

The bootc-image-builder is designed to run from a container. We create a `config.toml` file to configure a user and use Podman to run the application with our container. More information at [bootc-image-builder](https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder).

[TIP]
=====
On the **imagemode** machine, where we are already connected as user **root**:

```bash
[root@imagemode image-mode]# mkdir output
[root@imagemode image-mode]# cat config.toml
[[blueprint.customizations.user]]
name = "demouser"
password = "redhat"
key = "ssh-rsa ...."
groups = ["wheel"]

[root@imagemode image-mode]# cat creating-vm.sh
#!/bin/bash

/usr/bin/podman run --rm -it --privileged --pull=newer --security-opt label=type:unconfined_t \
           -v $(pwd)/config.toml:/config.toml:ro -v $(pwd)/output:/output -v /var/lib/containers/storage:/var/lib/containers/storage \
           registry.redhat.io/rhel9/bootc-image-builder:latest \
           --type qcow2 --local registry.lab.melmac.univ:5000/rhel-bootc-vm:latest

if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
  echo "An error occurred while creating the VM"
  exit 1
fi

/usr/bin/qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 -o lazy_refcounts=on $(pwd)/output/qcow2/disk.qcow2 $(pwd)/output/image-mode-test.qcow2
[root@imagemode image-mode]# bash creating-vm.sh
...
[root@imagemode image-mode]#
```

**It will be necessary to wait for the script execution to complete before continuing with the lab.**
=====

[IMPORTANT]
=====
Check the **config.toml** configuration file as it defines the user that will be used to connect to the virtual machine we are going to create, along with their password. It also configures the public key of the **root** user of the **imagemode** machine. This allows access from that user to the created machine via SSH with the **demouser** user without providing a password. However, in the newly created machine, we will need the **demouser** user’s password to access the **root** user.
=====

Once the script has finished executing, the virtual machine disk will have been created and placed inside the **output** directory. The script copies this disk to a shared unit so that the virtual machine can be run on the laptop.

[TIP]
=====
Using the **cd** and **ls** commands, you can navigate the **output** directory created on the **imagemode** machine to see the type of content that has been generated.
=====

The previous script has created, as you have seen, a virtual disk for KVM called **disk.qcow2**, inside the **output** directory. On the laptop, a virtual machine is already defined to run from this file after copying it to a shared folder, overwriting the existing file.

[TIP]
=====
To start the virtual machine with the created disk in the graphical environment of the laptop, go to the launcher at the bottom and click on **Launch VM**, which will start the virtual machine **image-mode-test** using the disk containing the virtual machine we created:

image::launchvm.png[]

Once the virtual machine has started:

image::vm.png[]
=====

Now we can connect to the virtual machine we have created and explore.

[TIP]
=====
There are two ways to connect:

* From the **imagemode** machine as the **root** user, we can connect via SSH to the created machine without using a password since we configured the public key in the **config.toml** file. The virtual machine we created is called **imagemodetest**:

```bash
[root@imagemode image-mode]# ssh demouser@imagemodetest
[demouser@imagemodetest ~]$
```

* The other way to connect is through the console we opened with **Launch VM**. In this case, it will ask for a password. The user and password are in the **config.toml** file.

From the laptop, open a browser tab and connect to the newly [created machine](https://imagemodetest.lab.melmac.univ) to verify that the application is working correctly.
=====

[IMPORTANT]
=====
As an example, we have deployed a very simple application since the goal of this lab is to illustrate the process necessary to create a virtual machine with an application using a container.
=====

[#update-rollback]
== Update and Rollback

+bootc+ is the command that manages containers within the VM. It includes a timer that regularly triggers a systemd service.
That service, if it detects that a new image is available, downloads it and restarts the system to apply the update.
[TIP]

After logging into the machine, we check that the timer is active. If we are not connected to the machine we created, imagemodetest, we connect to it using the root user from the imagemode machine:
[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

Oct 04 09:23:58 imagemodetest.lab.melmac.univ systemd[1]: Started Apply bootc updates.
[root@imagemodetest ~]#

=====

Note that when logging in with the demouser user, we see a welcome message: Welcome to a machine deployed with bootc-container-vm v1. This message will change after the update we are about to perform.

Now, we will create a new image and push it to the registry. This will cause the system to update automatically, as the timer will detect that a new version of the container is available.
[IMPORTANT]

Note that during the update process, it is NOT necessary to create the virtual machine from the container with the changes. The VM creation from a container is done ONLY the first time.
Once the VM is created, updating the container is enough to apply the changes.
[TIP]

On the imagemodetest machine, we will check the available versions:

We see that there is only one version available on the machine (Version: 9.20240930.0 (2024-10-04T09:19:28Z)), and it is in the registry registry.lab.melmac.univ:5000/rhel-bootc-vm:latest. This is the container we initially created and used to build the VM.

Now, we will check the status of the bootc-fetch-apply-updates service on the imagemodetest machine. This service monitors the registry containing the container used to build the VM:

...

This session will remain "locked" and continuously display all service notifications. For this reason, we must open another session to the imagemode machine.

We open another terminal on the laptop and connect to the imagemode machine. We will use the Containerfile.rhel9.4.mod file, where we have modified some aspects, such as installing the tmux package.

We will execute the bash create-container-mod.sh script, which will create the new version of the bootc container.

In this case, it is not necessary to create the VM image again since it already exists. Our only concern is updating the VM with the new modifications.

Before creating the updated image, it would be useful to bring the Launch VM console and the SSH shell to the foreground so we can see the machine restarting:

Once both are in the foreground, we proceed in the SSH console:

=====

[IMPORTANT]
=====
For simplicity, a local registry has been installed, and only one copy of the container image with the **latest** tag is maintained.

In a production system, the registry will contain several container images tagged with their corresponding versions, for example, **v1**, **v2**, etc., and the **latest** tag would be used to "point" to the version that needs to be run in production.

If the decision were made to use the timer for auto-update, then when performing the rollback, the **latest** tag would be changed in the registry to point to the container version being rolled back. This way, the registry information is consistent with the production configuration.
=====

[NOTE]
=====
You can detect if the update isn't working correctly and perform a rollback automatically. This method is done using https://github.com/fedora-iot/greenboot[greenboot], which is the same mechanism used by the RHEL version for Edge. This feature is currently being integrated with the **bootc** containers and will be available in the future.

== Next steps

We have seen:

* How to create a virtual machine from a container.
* The update process is as simple as recreating the container with the necessary updates from the one from which we created the virtual machine.
* The update can be done automatically, although it can also be launched manually using automations.
* The update process is very quick and easy.
* The rollback process is very quick and easy.

If you'd like to learn more, you can ask us during the event or speak to your company's Red Hat account team and request a session with RHEL specialists.
