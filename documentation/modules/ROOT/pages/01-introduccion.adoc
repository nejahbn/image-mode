== Bootable Containers

Bootable containers or **bootc** is a tool used to create containers that include the kernel, bootloader, or other components that are not typically included in containers. Once this type of container is created, it is uploaded to a registry like any other container, and using **image builder**, we can create RHEL images that can be deployed on any infrastructure, including physical machines, virtual machines, or cloud providers.

This new way of managing the operating system also allows updating these components from bootable container images.

Bootable containers are containers that implement the OCI standard to build a container that includes the operating system along with the kernel. All of this is done using existing tools for building containers, such as https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-podman[podman].

[IMPORTANT]
====
RHEL Image Mode is currently available in RHEL 9.4 as a **Technology Preview (TP)**, meaning it is not yet ready for production use. However, it can be used to become familiar with the technology so that when it reaches **General Availability (GA)**, those who find it useful can start using it immediately.
