RHEL Image Mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a new deployment method that uses a container-based approach to manage the operating system through containers.

It is currently available as a Technology Preview, meaning it is not supported for production use. However, it can be used to become familiar with Image Mode and explore not only how it fits but also what solutions it offers to customers facing today's challenges.

RHEL Image Mode follows a GitOps and CI/CD methodology to manage everything from deployed applications to the operating system itself.

The goal of this lab is to get started with RHEL Image Mode:

1. Create a virtual machine from a container image.
2. Perform an update on the virtual machine.
3. Manually perform a rollback.
